# EN18031 Compliance Cards - Session Progress (Continued)

**Date**: 2025-12-13 (Continuation)  
**Starting Point**: 34/44 cards complete (77%)  
**Current Status**: 37/44 cards complete (84%)

## Session Accomplishments

### Cards Enhanced (3 cards: 024, 025, 026)

**024: Model Backdoor Prevention** (13K → 47K):
- Added comprehensive backdoor attack taxonomy
- Expanded detection methods (Neural Cleanse, STRIP, Activation Clustering, Fine-Pruning)
- Detailed supply chain validation implementation
- Production monitoring system with real-time detection
- Complete implementation architecture and code patterns
- Enhanced validation strategy with metrics
- Comprehensive evidence requirements

**025: Model Supply Chain Security** (7.8K → 56K):
- Complete AI supply chain threat landscape
- Detailed component validation pipeline
- SBOM generation and management
- Private registry architecture
- Vendor assessment framework
- CI/CD integration patterns
- Comprehensive monitoring and incident response

**026: AI System Monitoring** (13K → 48K):
- Multi-dimensional monitoring architecture
- Comprehensive monitoring implementation with alerting
- Drift detection system (Evidently AI integration)
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Complete dashboard configuration
- Performance targets and SLAs
- Validation strategy and metrics

## Cards Remaining (7 cards to 90%+)

### Under 10K - Need Major Expansion:
1. **027**: Inference Security (9.9K) - needs 8-12K
2. **028**: Model Serving Infrastructure (8.5K) - needs 10-15K
3. **029**: AI System Performance Monitoring (7.0K) - needs 12-15K
4. **031**: Output Validation (4.7K boilerplate) - needs 15-20K
5. **032**: Rate Limiting Abuse Prevention (4.8K boilerplate) - needs 15-20K
6. **033**: AI System Rollback (4.8K boilerplate) - needs 15-20K
7. **011**: Data Provenance (4.8K duplicate) - needs 25-30K

### Priority Order:
1. Complete cards 027-029 (deployment security/performance)
2. Implement cards 031-033 (operational controls)
3. Fix card 011 (data provenance duplicate)

## Quality Improvements

Each card now includes:
- ✅ Comprehensive regulatory context with cross-framework mappings
- ✅ Detailed threat landscape and attack vectors
- ✅ Production-grade implementation code (500-1000 lines)
- ✅ Architecture diagrams and system designs
- ✅ Complete validation strategies with metrics
- ✅ Evidence requirements with audit trail specifications
- ✅ Related controls with implementation order
- ✅ Detailed status checklists

## Metrics

**Current Coverage**: 84% (37/44 cards at high quality)
**Content Added**: ~100K (47K + 56K + 48K = 151K)
**Total Content**: ~1.25MB

**Remaining Work**: ~120-150K content across 7 cards to reach 90%+

## Next Steps

1. Continue with cards 027-029 (deployment layer)
2. Implement cards 031-033 (operational layer)
3. Resolve card 011 duplicate issue
4. Run final audit
5. Commit with comprehensive message

## Patterns Established

- **Architecture Diagrams**: ASCII art system diagrams for each card
- **Implementation Code**: 500-1000 lines of production-quality Python
- **Metrics**: Specific thresholds, SLAs, and measurement criteria
- **Cross-References**: Detailed related controls with implementation dependencies
- **Evidence**: Comprehensive audit trail and documentation requirements
