### Critical Path Activities

#### **Must Complete Before External Audit**
1. Risk assessment completed
2. All policies and procedures documented and approved
3. Controls implemented and operating
4. Evidence collection system in place
5. Internal audit completed with findings remediated
6. Training completed and documented
7. Management review conducted
8. All documentation organized and accessible

#### **High-Risk Delays (Avoid These)**
- Waiting for executive approval (secure early buy-in)
- Vendor delays (technical controls, tools)
- Resource constraints (competing priorities)
- Scope creep (scope definition critical)
- Finding remediation (address promptly)
- Evidence gaps (continuous collection, not last-minute)
