### Stakeholder Analysis & Mapping

#### **Power-Interest Grid**

```
High Power, High Interest (Manage Closely)
- CEO, CCO, Board
- External Auditors
- Regulators

High Power, Low Interest (Keep Satisfied)
- CFO (resource allocation)
- CIO (technology decisions)

Low Power, High Interest (Keep Informed)
- Department Managers
- Compliance Team Members
- Employees in regulated roles

Low Power, Low Interest (Monitor)
- General staff
- Low-risk vendors
```

#### **RACI Matrix Example** (SOC 2 Implementation)

| Activity | CEO | CCO | CISO | IT | Legal | Ext. Auditor |
|----------|-----|-----|------|----|----|-------------|
| Scoping | A | R | C | C | C | I |
| Policy Development | A | R | C | C | R | - |
| Control Implementation | I | A | R | R | C | - |
| Evidence Collection | I | A | C | R | C | - |
| Internal Testing | I | R | C | R | C | - |
| Audit Coordination | I | R | R | C | C | R |
| Report Review | A | R | C | I | C | R |

**Legend**: R = Responsible, A = Accountable, C = Consulted, I = Informed
