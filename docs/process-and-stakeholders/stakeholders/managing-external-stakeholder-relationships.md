*Part of: [Compliance Process and Stakeholders](../index.md)*

### Best Practices

#### **Proactive Communication**
- Don't wait for audit requests; share updates regularly
- Announce certifications and achievements
- Notify of material changes (systems, scope, incidents)

#### **Centralized Information**
- Maintain a compliance artifact repository
- Use trust centers for customer-facing information
- Single source of truth for policies and evidence

#### **Relationship Management**
- Assign relationship owners for key stakeholders
- Regular check-ins (even outside audit cycles)
- Understand their priorities and pain points

#### **Preparation is Key**
- Mock audits before real audits
- Evidence collection ongoing (not last-minute)
- Staff training for auditor interactions

#### **Transparency**
- Disclose issues proactively when appropriate
- Don't hide problems; show how you're addressing them
- Auditors and regulators appreciate honesty

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Treating audits as adversarial** - Auditors are there to help, not catch you
❌ **Providing too much information** - Answer questions directly, don't volunteer extra issues
❌ **Hiding incidents** - Always worse when discovered later
❌ **Ignoring vendor compliance** - Your vendors' failures become your failures
❌ **Last-minute evidence collection** - Shows poor controls if you can't produce evidence quickly
❌ **Letting relationships lapse** - Stay in touch between formal engagements
